     8   10   14

a) a binary search tree
b) a min-heap
c) a max-heap
d) none of the above

=================

2) I have used a sort which I only know the program of that sorted "aa bb aA bB AA dd cC" into "aa aA AA bb bB cC dd" in <0.01ms, given 'a' and 'A' are treated equally. What can I conclude about this sort?

a) it is stable
b) it can sort in nlog(n) time
c) my machine runs an i7
d) none of the above

=================

     2
    / \
   1   8
      /
      6

=================

4) What is the order I would traverse the following Graph in a Breadth First Search from 1, holding preference over low numbers?

   0 --- 1
  /       \
 2 ------- 3
  \
   4 --- 5

a) 1 0 3 2 4 5
b) 1 0 2 3 1 (3) (2) 4 5
c) 1 2 3 4 5
d) all the paths above are incorrect

=================

5) I wish to implement a priority queue ADT, which acts as a queue, except when adding a number with a higher priority, it gets preference. For example, if I had the priority queue "1 4 5" and added 3, it would become "1 3 4 5". What is the most appropriate data structure?

a) a linked list
b) a tree
c) a graph
d) a heap

=================

6) What is the worst case complexity of the following algorithm?

int i, j;
for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    int m = 0;
    
    for (j = 0; j < size - i; j++) {
        if (array[j] > array[m]) {
            m = j;
        }  
    }
    
    swap(&(array[size-1-i]), &(array[m]));
}

a) O(n)
b) O(nlog(n))
c) O(n^2)
d) O(1)

=================

7) Which of the following best determines the problem with using a Hash Table?
a) it is hard to implement in real life practice
b) all hash tables takes up too much space in memory to store an indefinite amount of elements
c) the hash function must be exceedingly great so that items using the hash with collisions are negligible 
d) nah man, hash tables ftw

=================

a) in-order
b) post-order
c) depth first search
d) none of the above

=================

a) nlog(n)
b) 64
c) 24
d) 8
