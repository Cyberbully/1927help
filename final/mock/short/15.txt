Using this image, show step by step the st and dist array by using:

a) Dijkstra's Algorithm, from S on the graph
With the information from st, what is the shortest path from S to D?
With the information from st, what is the shortest path from F to B?

b) Prim's Algorithm, from A on the graph
What is the total cost?
